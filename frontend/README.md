# Pluggy Connect Quickstart

Here you'll find every possible Pluggy Connect integration with different client-side tools.

For most up-to-date and accurate documentation regarding both **Pluggy Connect** and **Connect Token**, please see
our [API Reference page](https://docs.pluggy.ai/#pluggy-connect-widget)

## Understanding the connect flow

When integrating the end-to-end Pluggy Connect Widget there is a connect flow that is important to understand. Whenever
you want to use the Pluggy API for any operation you'll have to first create an access token using your
corresponding `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`. This will allow you to create, read, update, delete and manipulate or
your users financial data. That's why this access token is intended to only be used from server-side environment, It's
really unsecure and/or dangerous to use it from the client-side, since any user that get access to this token can do the
same operations as you (involving other users/customers data).

That's why there is another type of token that is called `connect token`, this one is meant to be use for any
client-side Pluggy library and it has only access to create new items but only read/modify the items created in the same
session. For any of the libraries listed in this folders and the browser
lib [pluggy.js](https://github.com/pluggyai/pluggy-js) you must use this token.

To create this token you can either add a new endpoint in your server that uses a `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`
generated access token to generate the connect token, you
can [check it in the official documentation](https://docs.pluggy.ai/#create-a-connect-token). If your application
doesn't have server-side code or you just want to separate it in another server you
can [just deploy this project](https://github.com/pluggyai/pluggy-connect-vercel) in minutes
with [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and get you're own endpoint for the connect token.

## Usage

### HTML

You can directly import `pluggy-connect.js` from our CDN to a `<script>` tag, specifying the library version:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.pluggy.ai/pluggy-connect/v0.1.1/pluggy-connect.js"></script>
```

After that, the `PluggyConnect` class is globally available. You can instantiate it like so:

```js
const pluggyConnect = new PluggyConnect({
  connectToken: 'your-connect-token-here',
  includeSandbox: false, // true to list sandbox/stub connectors for testing
  onSuccess: (itemData) => {
    // do something with the financial data
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    // handle the error
  },
});

// open the Pluggy Connect widget
pluggyConnect.init();
```

### React

Install the npm package:

```bash
npm install react-pluggy-connect
```

Then, you can import and use the `PluggyConnect` component. For example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import { PluggyConnect } from 'react-pluggy-connect';

const App = (props) => {
  const onSuccess = (itemData) => {
    // do something with the financial data
  };

  const onError = (error) => {
    // handle the error
  };

  return (
    <PluggyConnect
      connectToken="your-connect-token-here"
      includeSandbox={false}
      onSuccess={onSuccess}
      onError={onError}
    />
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
